## Introduction
Originally a prototype I developed in 2017 for a former fellow student who was in cooperation with [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/en). This app was developed with Android Studio 2.3 for Android API 21 (Android 5.1) to API 25 (Android 7.0). This prototype was to form the basis for an app on which Telekom customers could watch movies, call up bills and top up credit.

## Purpose
This app was a prototype that allowed you to watch movies and subscribe to Deutsche Telekom. Instead of real movies and invoices, you could watch embedded movie trailers from Youtube. The invoices were actually dummy invoices in PDF format that could be opened in the app. The app included an innovative design for movie selection.

## Future
No plans are taking place to implement the prototype as an app. Many libraries, such as Calligraphy, are deprecated and the code needs to be completely rebuilt to make the app work again.  

## Notes
The app needs to be updated from *API 25* to *API 29*.  It was created with *Android Studio 2.3 (2017)* and *Gradle 3.1.3.*. It was developed using Java 8. On higher versions of Android Studio, the app causes errors because all libraries are no longer supported.
